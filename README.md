## Questions 1-3
Questions 1-3 have been answered throughout the notebook. You can view the notebook within this repository or at [nbviewer.com](https://nbviewer.org/github/nefrank/replica-analytics-questions-mle/blob/main/USCensus.ipynb?flush_cache=True) for better readability.

## Question 4
A Flask REST app named '/API/app.py' can be run to demonstrate the API. It can train and predict for both models based on the uploaded US Census data. Model parameters can be selected and models can named and saved. Saved models can be selected to make a prediction based on a fillable form containing the features from the dataset with the result displayed.

Here is a walkthrough of the process:

Upload US Census data:

## Question 5
A unit testing file named '/API/test.py' can be run to perform the unit tests on the web app and API. The tests are described within the comments of the file.
